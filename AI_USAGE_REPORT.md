## Sample Prompts (Key Examples)

### 1. Dashboard Component Creation
```
"Create a responsive React dashboard component with metric cards, interactive charts, 
and real-time data updates. Use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts. Include 
mobile-first design with touch-friendly interactions."
```
**Result**: Generated comprehensive dashboard with MetricCard components, ChartCardWrapper, and responsive layouts

### 2. Advanced Filtering System
```
"Help me implement an advanced filter system with date ranges, multi-select options, 
and filter summary display. Include TypeScript interfaces and React state management 
with proper loading states."
```
**Result**: Created AdvancedFilters component with date pickers, select components, and filter state management

### 3. Chart Reload Functionality
```
"Implement chart reload functionality on reset button click with loading states and 
smooth transitions. Charts should re-render with new keys and show visual feedback 
during the refresh process."
```
**Result**: Added resetData function with loading states, chart key-based re-rendering, and smooth UX transitions

### 4. Mobile Optimization
```
"Make the analytics dashboard more responsive for mobile applications. Optimize touch 
interactions, reduce chart complexity on small screens, and improve navigation."
```
**Result**: Implemented mobile-specific layouts, touch-friendly buttons, and responsive chart configurations

### 5. Code Cleanup and Quality
```
"Check my codebase for cleanliness - identify duplicate components, unused files, 
TypeScript errors, and optimization opportunities."
```
**Result**: Systematic cleanup removing 4+ duplicate files, fixing all TypeScript errors, and improving code organization
